# setup-dashboard-https.sh
#
# Gives the AI agents' Mini App dashboard (the ai-dashboard service) a public
# HTTPS address:
#   https://<your-ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io[:port]  ->  Caddy (Let's Encrypt)  ->  127.0.0.1:8787
#
# Prerequisite: this repo is cloned to /opt/ai-dashboard.
# Migrating from the old in-process dashboard? Use migrate-from-coding-agent.sh
# instead: it reuses the HTTPS address you already have.
#
# Each step checks before it changes anything, and stops with an explanation
# instead of half-configuring. Safe to re-run.
#
# The dashboard gets its own Caddy site file (/etc/caddy/sites/); the main
# Caddyfile only gains an import line, so other sites in it are left alone.
#
# Usage:   sudo bash setup-dashboard-https.sh            # auto-detect public IP
#          sudo bash setup-dashboard-https.sh 1.2.3.4    # or pass it explicitly
#
# HTTPS_PORT (default 443) picks the public port, for hosts where 443 is taken
# (e.g. by an MTProto proxy). The certificate is still issued over port 80:
#          sudo HTTPS_PORT=8443 bash setup-dashboard-https.sh
#
